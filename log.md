# Log
- Made a key vault 
    - RG: Blog_RG
    - Name: vm-test1-kv
    - Region: Southeast Asia
- Changed `terraform.tfvars` 
    - VNET name: vnet-terraform-modulesdev-sea
    - Location: Southeast Asia
- Added Keyvault administration IAM permission to personal account
    - Unsure why even though I am owner, but now I can add secrets
- Added Secrets into vm-test1-kv
    - name: virtual-machine-user
    - secret value: codesalmon
    - name: virtual-machine-password
    - secret value: CodeSalmon-
- Changed `network/variables.tf`
    - Commented out validation for region
    - Changed default region to "Southeast Asia"
- Changed `terraform.tfvars`
    - Changed VNET rg to "rg-vm-test1"
- Added storage account, storage container into `storage.tf` file
    - This is to store .tfstate instead of provisioning through portal
    - Note that only keyvault have been provisioned manually through portal and it exists at a different resource group
- Encountered an error as storage account and container need to exist before `terraform init` is called
    - Will create through a separate IAC code
    - Created `terraform-presetup` to setup storage account
